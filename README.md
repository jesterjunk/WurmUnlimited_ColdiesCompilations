# Coldies Compilations (NOT MY MODS)

This is a "fork" of the coldies compilations code dump in
<a href="https://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/167518-released-coldies-compilations/">this post</a>,
downloaded from <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjnBltNOSFjChBbyg19L010tzkih?e=WWZbR9">here</a>.

I will gradleify the code, and modify the mods, possibly even release some. If you want the original,
unchanged source code, the zip file "Coldies Mods.zip" will always have that.

Friya's Loot Tables mod (compiled) is
also here in "loottables.zip".


# About the versioning.

Every mod, regardless of its previous version, will be released (practically unchanged) as version "ty1.0".

I can not guarantee that version the "ty1.0" mods here will work. Any mod released at a version greater than that will
have been tested and working (and possibly modified);


# The mods

Following are the mods present here. I will add a description of everything it does,
and then list the changes that I have made to them.
